# graphql-jpa-spring-boot-starter
Spring Boot starter for GraphQL JPA; Expose JPA entities with [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/).

Builds on [GraphQL for JPA](https://github.com/jcrygier/graphql-jpa),
which in turn builds on [GraphQL Java](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java)
to expose JPA Entities through a `/graphql` endpoint.

Many thanks to @jcrygier for the initial hard work; This is mostly just a wrapper.
